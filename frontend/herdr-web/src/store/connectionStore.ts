/**
 * Connection state store.
 *
 * State is driven by three inputs:
 *  - the initial /health probe (`probe()`): herdr.connected decides Live vs
 *    Unavailable, a network/auth failure is Offline;
 *  - SSE "connection.changed" events (payload {state, error} from
 *    herdr_harness/service.py — `state === "connected"` means the herdr
 *    event stream is attached);
 *  - eventStream liveness: an open SSE stream means the backend is reachable,
 *    so "Offline" is at least upgraded away.
 *
 * "Demo" is a manual mode (setDemo) that suppresses probe-driven transitions.
