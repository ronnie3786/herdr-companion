# Herdr for iOS

The iPhone app connects directly to the standalone Herdr server. It includes
terminal and Pi chat views, machine management, notes, and Herd Pulse Live Activities.
No other orchestration server is required.

Use Xcode 26.2 or newer. Open `herdr-harness-ios.xcodeproj`, select the shared
`herdr-harness-ios` scheme, and run on an iPhone simulator. Add `-HerdrDemoMode` as a
launch argument to explore sample content without any server.

For device signing and the optional machine roster, use the single private cluster
TOML and [Apple configuration guide](../herdr-harness-mac/APPLE_CONFIGURATION.md).
The public project has an empty signing team and neutral development identifiers.
API tokens are entered at runtime and saved only in Keychain.

See the [repository README](../README.md) for server setup. Simulator may connect
to `http://localhost:9092`; physical devices require an HTTPS address reachable from
the phone. Tailscale Serve is one option for a private network.

Build the app, widget, and tests without signing:

```bash
xcodebuild -project herdr-harness-ios/herdr-harness-ios.xcodeproj \
  -scheme herdr-harness-ios -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build-for-testing
```
