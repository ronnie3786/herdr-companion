# Next macOS update — unreleased

## Sidebar and navigation

- Recents uses compact single-line titles, quieter machine/workspace context, and visible Working, Done, and attention states. Full tab context stays available on hover.
- Leaving Recents restores the ordinary grouped-row styling. Selected chats keep their background highlight without a leading vertical stripe.
- Sidebar titles and status read live pane data so Smart Rename and agent completion stay aligned with the chat header and HUD.
- Back and Forward remember Chat/Git segment switches on the same pane, including returning to Git after visiting another pane or screen.
- New workspace is a labeled sidebar action. Hover a machine row for a folder-plus button that opens creation directly on that machine, without another machine selection. Workspace headings in Unread and Starred expose the same right-click menu as the workspace tree, including New tab.

## Chat and HUD

- Attachment chips remain compact and scroll horizontally instead of stretching the composer.
- Long prompt drafts scroll with the mouse or trackpad after reaching five visible lines. Existing Return and modified-Return behavior is retained.
- Grouped tool calls are labeled Clanking. Failures remain indicated in the collapsed header and no longer expand the group automatically.
- The HUD notes list starts as one Notes icon. Click to expand; click again to minimize. Creating or opening a note still opens its editable card.

## Companion compatibility

The Mac UI changes require no API contract change. A separate companion update raises the shared headless-agent timeout, including HUD chat, from ten minutes to one hour by default. A Mac-only update does not change the running server's timeout. Existing explicit overrides remain effective; `HERDR_HARNESS_AGENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` supports 1–86,400 seconds through the private configuration's `[environment]` table. Cancellation remains available.

## Quick verification

1. Toggle Recents on and off; Smart Rename a chat and compare its sidebar/header title. Let a working agent finish and compare the sidebar with its HUD notification.
2. Switch Chat → Git → another pane; use Back twice and Forward twice.
3. Attach multiple images, enter a draft longer than five lines, and scroll inside the editor. Confirm Return sends and modified Return inserts a newline.
4. Open a conversation with a failed tool call: Clanking should remain collapsed and show the failure count.
5. Toggle Notes twice, create a note, and close its card. Use New workspace and right-click workspace headings to find New tab.
